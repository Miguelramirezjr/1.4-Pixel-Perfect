           <p>Paddleboarding got its roots in Hawaii in the 1960s when the Beach Boys of Waikiki started standing on their longboards and using outrigger paddles to paddle out for a better view of the surf. The sport didn’t take off until the 2000s when pro surfers such as Laird Hamilton used SUP to continue training when the ocean was too calm to surf. Today SUP has gone mainstream, and the World Paddle Association (WPA) makes it easy to find races, meetups, and classes across the country. Try White’s tips on how to get started with this exploding sport for yourself.</p>

          <p>Even though paddleboarding is a total-body workout, people of all ages and fitness levels can try the sport. Unlike surfing, you don’t need waves to paddleboard, and very calm, flat water is best for beginners. “Surfing didn’t take over mainstream America because the majority of us don’t live by the surf, but the beauty of paddleboarding is that you can do it on an ocean, lake, and even a river,” says White.</p>

          <p>One of the worst things you can do when starting any sport is to get the wrong equipment,” says White. “If you get a board that’s too small for your weight or ability, it will be unstable and you’ll think SUP is too hard or that you suck.</p>
